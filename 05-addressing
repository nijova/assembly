absolute: $c000
the full memory location is used as the argument

zero page: $c0
only the first page of memory is accessible

zero page,X: $c0,X
a zero page address is given, and then the value of the X register is added
zero page,Y: $c0,Y

absolute,X and absolute,Y: $c000,X and $c000,Y
absolute addressing versions of zero page,X and zero page,Y

immediate: #$c0
actual values are used, very different to the zero page instruction

relative: $c0 (or label)
used for branching instructions. These instructions take a single byte, which is used as an offset from the following instruction.

implicit
instruction don’t deal with memory locations

indirect: ($c000)
uses an absolute address to look up another address. The first address gives the least significant byte of the address, and the following byte gives the most significant byte

indexed indirect: ($c0,X)
a cross between zero page,X and indirect. take the zero page address, add the value of the X register to it, then use that to look up a two-byte address

indirect indexed: ($c0),Y
the zero page address is dereferenced, and the Y register is added to the resulting address

we can define descriptive constants (or symbols) that represent numbers. The rest of the code can then simply use the constants instead of the literal number, which immediately makes it obvious what we’re dealing with
