BNE: Branch on not equal

CPX compares the value in the X register with another value, CPX #$03
 If the two values are equal, the Z flag is set to 1, otherwise it is set to 0.

BNE label will shift execution to the label if the Z flag is set to 0 (meaning that the two values in the CPX comparison were not equal)

Labels just mark certain points in a program so we can return to them later.

The opposite of BNE is BEQ
BCC and BCS (“branch on carry clear” and “branch on carry set”) are used to branch on the carry flag
